  	<p class="statement">This page outlines the 12 stages that make up the AllStyle Homes Building Process that will turn your dream into reality.</p> 
 <!--   
    <p class="statement"><span class="bo">PLEASE NOTE: </span>It is important to understand that we begin this process with the assumption that you have already purchased a block of land or that you have the intention of purchasing a block in the near future. As we explain in our FAQ page, AllStyle Homes is only a building/construction company. We are not a licensed Real Estate Agency. And our business is not in the purchasing/selling of land.</p>

    

    
    <p><span class="clbold">STAGE 1: The Initial Meeting: </span> If you already own property, it would be advantageous to bring along any or all of the following documents to this first meeting</p>
        <ul class="our_processes">
        	<li>the site address (street address, GPS),</li>
            <li>surveyor reports,</li>
            <li>elevation certificate,</li>
            <li>orientation (sun rising/setting, prevailing wind/weather)</li>
            <li>geology and soil testing reports,</li>
            <li>land governances, and</li>
            <li>council restrictions/stipulations, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: If any or all of this information is not provided, additional research and applications may need to be undertaken before further planning can commence.</p>
        <p>Even before the first meeting, try to have spent some time considering what you are looking for. Jot down your thoughts as to the following:</p>
        <ul class="our_processes">
        	<li>number of bedrooms, baths, family rooms</li>
            <li>entertainment areas</li>
            <li>flooring (timber, tile, vinyl, carpets</li>
            <li>ceilings (flat, raked)</li>
            <li>“open living” or traditional</li>
            <li>sample designs, including drawings, sketches, brochures, pictures, or magazine articles you may have assembled</li>
            <li>“must haves” and "wish list" for your home</li>
            <li>pick some designs from our online selection</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All of these aspects and more will be discussed and we consider all the options. Our goal is that by the end of the first meeting, the client will have settled on a specific design (or at least narrowed down the list). If not, a second meeting can easily be arranged.</p>
        <p>We will review all aspects of your new home and establish your budget. We can refer you to a financing entity if you do not already have one.</p>
  
        
        
 <p><span class="clbold">STAGE 2: Preliminary Plans: </span> By this stage, the client should have decided if they want a custom built home ("from scratch", original floor plans) or a style from our range of existing floor plans. At this stage the final concept (from the last stage) is reviewed, and:</p>
        
        <p><span class="bo">If you are building a custom home: </span> The pricing scheme will be discussed – each house has a “Standard Design” cost with base features. The client can then add “options” at additional costs. You will then meet with the designer to start preliminary plans. A deposit for the drawing of the plans must be made. Upon our entering a contract, the deposit is deducted from the cost of your contract. During this stage we work closely with the designer to make sure your home design offers the latest in innovation & energy efficiency, fits your needs and desires, and can be built within your established budget.</p>
        
        <p><span class="bo">If you are building one of our floor plans: </span> The plans will be discussed. If you want to accept the design exactly as is there will not be any cost for the plans. If you wish to modify the design or add "options" at additional cost, then a deposite will be required for the re-drawing of the plans.</p>
        
        
        <p><span class="clbold">STAGE 3: Interior Design: </span> For clients choosing both custom homes or existing styles, we offer a range of options, within the areas of:
        	<ul class="our_processes">
            	<li>land clearing and fill dirt</li>
        		<li>landscaping</li>
        		<li>floor coverings (tiles, timber, vinyl, carpet, etc)</li>
                <li>wall coverings (paint, wallpaper, etc)</li>
        		<li>cabinets, countertops & built-ins</li>
        		<li>appliances & Electrical Fixtures</li>
            	<li>security and technology systems</li>
                <li>decorative Fixtures</li>
        	</ul>
        </p>
        <p>“Options” allow the client to have the maximum freedom of choice while being made aware how their (additional) cost impacts on the final cost. </p>
 
        <p><span class="clbold">STAGE 4:  Final Design Phase Begins: </span>During this phase, your home design is refined and completed. Other activities during this phase include meetings scheduled for you to: </p>
        	<ul class="our_processes">
            	<li>select colours & finish items with the interior designer</li>
                <li>visit the cabinetmaker to select & finalize your cabinet package</li>
                <li>select appliances in the appliance suppliers' showroom</li>
                <li>meet with any other vendor or subcontractor requiring coordination.</li>
            </ul>
        
        <p><span class="clbold">STAGE 5: Final Costing: </span> Once your plans have been finalised, AllStyle Homes will then provide you with a quotation.  The quote will outline the cost of building your dream home based on your design incorporating all of your ideas, wants and needs.</p>
        
        
        <p><span class="clbold">STAGE 6: Contract Execution: </span>At this all decisions, including colours, cabinets, appliances, and flooring should be made, your final pricing is completed, and your financing is in place.</p>
        
        <p>A Building Contract will then be prepared, with a commencement date set.  Upon signing of the contract the warranty insurance can be applied for.  A deposit is then payable on the return of the warranty insurance.  AllStyle Homes will arrange for the completion of a soil test, site survey and plans will be Energy Rated.</p>
        
<p>Working drawings will be completed showing ‘site plan’, floor plan, external elevations, electrical layout, floor coverings, kitchen and bathroom joinery details and landscape/concrete/fencing details if required.</p>
        
        <p><span class="clbold">STAGE 7: Building Department & Governmental Agency Permitting:  </span>Once the contract is signed and the warranty insurance received a Building permit will be applied for, to the Local Council Authority.  ‘Proof of ownership’ of land is needed by way of title showing our name, rates notice or confirmation letter from conveyance/solicitor with volume and folio numbers.  As well as letter of finance. </p>
        
        
        <p><span class="clbold">STAGE 8: Site Preparation: </span>Planning is complete and the construction process has begun. In this stage, the focus is on preparing the site and may include the removal/relocation of trees, escavation, site levelling, etc.  </p>
		
        
        <p><span class="clbold">STAGE 9: Foundations: </span>All footings and underground plumbing/electrical are dug to specifications, steel reinforcement laid before the pouring of the concrete. Some clients like to be present to cast a memento into the concrete.</p>
        
        
        <p><span class="clbold">STAGE 10: Framing: </span>External and internal wall frames, roof trusses are complete.  In addition, many of the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing installations are completed.</p> 
                
       	<p>You may want to be present at the jobsite for this phase, when we schedule a jobsite meeting and together we thoroughly inspect the home prior to the wall linings being installed. Specific items we will be inspecting include not only general overall conformance to the plans and design, but specifically the plumbing, electrical, HVAC, and technology installations to allow for easy modifications you may desire before drywall is installed.</p>
        
        
        <p><span class="clbold">STAGE 11: "Lock-up" Stage: </span>External cladding or brickwork, roofing material, external doors and windows are fixed.</p>
        
        
        <p><span class="clbold">STAGE 12: Fixtures and Fittings: </span>All internal cladding, architraves, skirting, doors, built in shelving and kitchen, bathroom/ensuite cabinets are fitted and fixed into position. All the finishing touches, tiling, painting, electrical and plumbing fit off are completed in accordance with the contract documents.</p>
        
        
        <p><span class="clbold">STAGE 13: Walk-through Inspection: </span>At the conclusion of construction and before you move in, we schedule a jobsite meeting and conduct a walk-through. During this meeting, we run through a checklist and inspect your entire home room by room and ensure your home is move-in ready.</p>
                
        <p>You will then meet with Alex and Sheree for a full handover/inspection inspection where they will explain the house to you and ensure that everything is as per your contract specification.</p>
                
        <p>At the conclusion of this inspection, we confirm your move-in date, finalize any financial transactions and completion documents, then any punch-list items generated from the walk-thru are coordinated with the subs to be completed prior to your move-in date.</p>
        
        
        <p><span class="clbold">STAGE 14: Handover/Move-In: </span>Your home is finished, all last minute items are complete, the local building department has issued the certificate of occupancy, your homeowners insurance policy is in place and the lender has made their final inspection and disbursement. Closing papers are signed and the keys are now yours. All that is left is for you to move in. Congratulations on your new home!</p>
    	
        
        <p><span class="clbold">STAGE 15: First Year Warranty Inspection : </span>As part of our commitment to you to honour our warranty, as the first year anniversary approaches , we will organise to conduct a comprehensive (and documented) walk-through inspection. And it is truly comprehensive – from the foundations to the roof; every tile; every nail; every fitting; every fixture; front door to backdoor. If it is deemed that any defect or imperfection is a result from our construction methods we will rectify the problem at our expense.</p>
