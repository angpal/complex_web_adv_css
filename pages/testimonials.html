    <p class="statement"><img src="../images/testimonials/invcom66.png" width="auto" height="19" alt="Enlarge inverted-comma '66'."/>AllStyle Homes did a fantastic job on our custom house.  We didn't want a cookie cutter design, so we worked with a great architect and came up with an “unusually unique” design that matched our vision.   Most builders grumbled when looking at the plans.  Alex and Sherre offered some suggestions to facilitate the process, but were on board 100% from the start.  After visiting their homes and some models, we were sold.</p>
    <p class="statement">Building a home is never easy, at least not for me.  I sweat the details.  Alex and Sheree put up with me and my wife and always gave good advice.  The result is our dream home, and it's just as we envisioned.  My wife and I, and our three kids all love it. <img src="../images/testimonials/invcom99.png" width="auto" height="19" alt="Enlarge inverted-comma '99'."/></p>

    <p class="statement"><img src="../images/testimonials/invcom66.png" width="auto" height="19" alt="Enlarge inverted-comma '66'."/>Initially, we looked at other local builders, but AllStyle Homes was our top choice. We felt very comfortable with the experienced staff at AllStyle Homes. Alex and Sheree worked closely with us to satisfy our needs and preferences. 
We were confident about the quality construction, but we actually learned this first hand when our home, nearing its completion, withstood Cyclone Charlie, a Category 4 system, in 2010. The walls and the roof were fully intact!</p>
<p class="statement">Four years later and we still love our home. The price was right and the quality is exceptional. We fully recommend AllStyle Homes to anyone that is looking for an honest builder that prides themselves on quality construction, and friendly service. <img src="../images/testimonials/invcom99.png" width="auto" height="19" alt="Enlarge inverted-comma '99'."/></p>

    <p class="statement"><img src="../images/testimonials/invcom66.png" width="auto" height="19" alt="Enlarge inverted-comma '66'."/>As a painting subcontractor myself, I recognised first hand the high quality of construction and materials that you use. I appreciate too the accuracy of your construction schedule. Not all builders are so well organized. I often deal with homeowners in the final stages of construction when I go to do the final paint touch up. I see firsthand which builders give the best customer satisfaction. Overwhelmingly, AllStyle Homes ranks among the highest in customer satisfaction.</p>
<p class="statement">As homeowners, both Donna and I appreciate how well organized AllStyle Homes is, how quickly concerns are addressed, and the genuine interest showed to us to make sure that we got what we wanted. Should we ever build again AllStyle Homes would be our contractor. Thanks so much for the great job you did on our house! <img src="../images/testimonials/invcom99.png" width="auto" height="19" alt="Enlarge inverted-comma '99'."/></p>

    <p class="statement"><img src="../images/testimonials/invcom66.png" width="auto" height="19" alt="Enlarge inverted-comma '66'."/>The building grew astonishing quickly and Alex and Sheree did a great job from the first day to the very end. They are very nice people, whom we trusted in every way and every time. </p>
<p class="statement">Whenever we wanted to change something, it was no problem. Alex managed it immediately and Sheree reliably updated our records. Sheree always found special stores that pleased our wishes. And last but not least, we think we paid a fair price for our wonderful home. <img src="../images/testimonials/invcom99.png" width="auto" height="19" alt="Enlarge inverted-comma '99'."/></p>

    <p class="statement"><img src="../images/testimonials/invcom66.png" width="auto" height="19" alt="Enlarge inverted-comma '66'."/>We did our homework when choosing a builder and did A LOT of comparing. Cost was of course the biggest factor, but equally important was the reputation of the builder. AllStyle Homes passed with flying colours.</p>
<p class="statement">Since we lived in another state, we had concerns about details slipping through the cracks, not being kept up to date and making long distance choices. Not with AllStyle Homes! I sensed that Sheree was very organized and detail oriented and she was - in spades! It made us very comfortable with the entire process. They built us a home that exceeded our expectations of quality and beauty. We made the right choice when it came to the builder.</p>
<p class="statement">The "after care" we received was incredible. The very few things that were not exactly to our liking, or something didn't fit - they were out and/or sub-contracted out remedying it immediately. This was very important. They really stand behind their work.
Check out AllStyle Homes, it is well worth it! <img src="../images/testimonials/invcom99.png" width="auto" height="19" alt="Enlarge inverted-comma '99'."/></p>

    <p class="statement"><img src="../images/testimonials/invcom66.png" width="auto" height="19" alt="Enlarge inverted-comma '66'."/>Alex is a man of integrity, a rare quality among contractors according to the “horror stories” we kept hearing about other builders (whose names will remain secret) from family and friends. When we noticed a crack in one tile in the laundry (some six months after moving in) my wife called Alex. Not more than 5 minutes on the job Alex said that the floor would be re-laid at his expense. Now that’s integrity and commitment!</p>
<p class="statement">Alex never ceased to amaze me with his knowledge of the building trade and efficiency in dealing with the authorities. Sheree really know her stuff and monitors everything that's going on.<img src="../images/testimonials/invcom99.png" width="auto" height="19" alt="Enlarge inverted-comma '99'."/></p>

    <p class="statement"><img src="../images/testimonials/invcom66.png" width="auto" height="19" alt="Enlarge inverted-comma '66'."/>Gary and I would like to express our sincere appreciation for the wonderful experience we have had building our new home.</p>
<p class="statement">This is the first time we have built from a distance (ie. whilst living in another town) and it has by far been the least “painful” of any build in the past! From the moment we met Alex and Sheree, we felt very comfortable that our needs would be met. Your team was always available to us and went above and beyond to ensure that we were kept “in the loop”, as to the progress of our home, every step of the way! Alex gave us his timeframe calendar (which we thought was very ambitious!) and, sure enough, he completed construction ahead of schedule!</p>
<p class="statement">You promised quality construction and boy, did you deliver! We love our new home and would not hesitate recommending you to anyone looking to build. <img src="../images/testimonials/invcom99.png" width="auto" height="19" alt="Enlarge inverted-comma '99'."/></p>
